## Inspiration

Mental health is a crucial aspect of overall well-being, yet many people struggle to access timely support and resources. According to the World Health Organization, depression affects **more than 264 million people worldwide, and anxiety disorders affect over 284 million people**. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these issues, leading to a significant increase in mental health challenges across all age groups. Inspired by these statistics and **the urgent need for accessible, proactive solutions, I created WeHear to provide continuous mental health surveillance, assessment, and support for individuals of all ages.**

## What it does

WeHear is a _comprehensive web application designed to monitor and assess mental health across all age groups_. It features **interactive quizzes** to evaluate mental well-being, tracks changes over time, and **provides personalized feedback and resources.** The app identifies potential mental health issues early and offers coping strategies, educational materials, and recommendations for professional support when necessary.

## How I built it

**Frontend**: Developed using React.js for a responsive and intuitive user interface.
**Backend**: Built with Nodejs and Express to handle data processing and user authentication.
**Database**: Implemented with MongoDb for secure storage and management of user data.
